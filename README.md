# HOMEWORK2_PORTFOLIO
## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a personal profolio to have all projects for users to view. 
In this project I've included the use of semantic tag, media queries, and pseudo classes.
- Header: Includes a header which includes a main header of my name and a navigation bar if you click, it will link you to sections of the page.
- Subheader: Inlcudes a photo of myself along with a subheader title welcoming you to my protfolio.
- Main:
    - About me: Two paragraphs
    - Work: 5 images in a flex container that will link you to future projects and assignments.
            - The main photo will link you to Project One.
            - Photos named weather dashboard and day planner has the assingment attached when clicked.
    - Contact: Footer section that have navigation links of my contact information. 
              - Clicking on the email will open a draft and clicking on github will direct you to my github page.
